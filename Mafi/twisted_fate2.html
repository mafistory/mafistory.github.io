                            She began to sorrow when she thought about her mother and Mrs. Rosario Luminè. Isabella silently asked herself in anguish, “why everyone loathes her?”. It’s because of her look or being born in this world with an ugly face. She thought at the old day when she was born, how it could be if she was the daughter of Mrs. Rosario Luminè, not born into a servant 
                            family. Isabella started to lay down on the floor with tears and slept without realizing it. </p>

                            Another day after a long night for Isabella in the storage room, she opened her eyes, saw the other side of the wall full of spider net, realizing that no one had come to see her yet. She pushed herself hard, trying to wake up with difficulty. At the moment, the door unlocked, showing two women at the doorway, her mother and her owner. Mrs. Rosario Luminè gave Isabella 
                            a fierce glare when she saw Isabella still lying down. 
                        </p>

                            Mrs. Rosario Luminès said, “Did I lock to sleep like that? You useless” Mrs. Rosario Luminè raised her voice so loud that makes Isabella trembled. Isabella said with the low voices and stammered when she saw the angry face of Mrs. Rosario Luminè, “I’m.... I’m sorry, madam” “Did you know why I locked up you here?” Isabella stayed put with tears run down her cheeks without replying to Mrs. Rosario Luminè because she knew that her word would have made Mrs. Rosario Luminè furious. “I’m locked you here to make you think who you are. What should you do or don’t? But why did you sleep?” Mrs. Rosario Luminè said. Mrs. Rosario Luminè started to fury when Isabella didn’t respond to her. She asked, “How come you ignore my word?  You garbage!’’.  Mrs. Rosario Luminè turned backward and asked Sophia Lou, “Looked how your daughter behaved to me, you made me disappointed in you. I’ve told you to correct your daughter's behavior, but she still made mistakes. Ummmm, I think you must be punished right, Sophia”. Sophia started to bow down a little bit to her mistress, “I’m sorry madam, I will teach her a hard lesson from now on,” Sophia said. Mrs. Rosario Luminè said, “I remember last time you said the same thing but nothing change. I decided to punish you both,” After hearing her mistress said that, Sophia turned her head to Isabella and scowling At Isabella. 
                            “You and your daughter will not be given anything to eat the whole day”.
