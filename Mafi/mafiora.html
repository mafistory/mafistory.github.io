                <p style="color:azure; text-indent: 50px;">Sometime I wonder, what is the meaning of love? and why is everyone seeking for love? 
                    People says, love has come in many forms. A motherly love is the love that we all can get from birth 
                    and this is the most powerful form of love.
                    Love can also be seen in family or in friendship. But, the love that makes people go crazy and can even do
                 something stupid is called romantic love. This kind of love is the most complicated one. Gender doesn't define this type of love.
                No matter who you are as long as you love each other it what matters the most. As for myself, I've never experienced the so-called romantic love.
                Until I've met someone. Mafiora Chung is my full name. In short, "Mafi" is what my friends has been calling me. 
                Currently, 18-year-old me is a freshmen of Estelle College. And I'm a part of Musical department.  </p>
