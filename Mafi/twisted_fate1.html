                            Sunday at 11:59 pm, in a small town in France, a 
                            stormy rain occurred strongly, as if it was crying for help. The sky was so dark with 
                            the lightning strike so loudly, which seemed to never end. At the moment, Mrs. Rosario 
                            luminè was giving birth to a daughter while the slave of their family name, Sophia, was 
                            also childbirth. As the rain stopped, Ms. Rosario saw her daughter getting out of the womb 
                            for the first time with the happiest smile on her face because her daughter was so beautiful 
                            and had very smooth fair glowing skin. The news of the mistress's daughter had made everyone 
                            in the mansion extremely joyful. The family even celebrated to welcome a new member to the 
                            family. According to their daughter's beauty, Master Luminè decided to name her “Albedo 
                            Luminè” due to stunning features like a flower shining brightly that no one could 
                            compare. On the other hand, Sophia gave birth to an unsightly daughter since there 
                            is a mark on her face. Yet, surprisingly Sophia looked so happy, false from everybody 
                            expected. Even though a huge mark was printed on the child's face, this kid's appearance
                             deems soft and elegant in a unique way. Those reasons were supportive enough to give 
                             Sophia's daughter the name “Isabella”.</p>
                        <p style="color:rgb(240, 198, 231); text-indent:50px;">
                            Years by years, Isabella turned 7 years old. 
                            One time, she was in the storage room all alone for one night, the reason for punishing was playing 
                            with the young mistress Albedo Luminè. Isabella sat down near one corner of the room, feeling grief 
                            for born without being loved by everyone. She rolled down her eyes, looked at everything in the room, 
                            touched the dirty on the floor, and started to cry in the darkness. Everything around her was like her 
                            lifestyle. The things that everyone looked over, hated, and throw away. She was in these 
                            situations. But suddenly, the hearing of stepping back of the shoes in front of the doorway
                             made Isabella feel better, thinking that her mother came to look for her; however, she was 
                             wrong. Hearing head back of the shoes stepped, Isabella was misery. The overwhelming emotion 
                             tormented and insulted her. Isabella suffered every day when no one had seen her goodness, 
                             effort, how hard she tried. Instead of being complimented, she’d gotten a bad word. She 
                             imagined silent helping from her own mother, loved by everyone that she had never had, 
                             praised by people, and cheering for doing greatness.</p>
