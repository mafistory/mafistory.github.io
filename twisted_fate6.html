                            However, Isabella went totally blank with the hideous smile; after she had asked another maid during the preparation. She realized that this was the engagement party of Albedo Luminé and Lucas. He was the man whom Isabella loved the most. After all, she knew exactly what was going to happen. So, Isabella kept holding her tears. Even though she was having a mental breakdown, she still tried to act as usual. The poor girl thought she was a fool that did not know her place. She blamed herself in the wild imagination and said, 
                            “you do not deserve to be with a high-class prince, Isabella!! Wake up and come to your sense."  
                        </p>
                        <p style="color:rgb(240, 198, 231); text-indent: 50px;">
                            About twenty-minute later, Lucas appeared in front of Isabella and trying to explain what had happened. He was having a conversation for a while with a serious looked. “Isabella, I'm afraid I can't keep our promise," said Lucas. Isabella was speechless and stood still. For a moment of silence, she managed to pull herself up and asked Lucas, "Have you ever genuinely loved me dearly?” her eyes were filled with anger. Then, Lucas said, “Sorry Isabella, I hope you forgive me, I have loved Albedo since the beginning. I am just messing with you, and I do not mean to keep it going on for this long time," after he said those words, he suddenly walked past Isabella, left her with a pathetically feeling. In fact, she did not know Lucas had lied to her to satisfy his noble family. Lucas broke his own heart and felt numb, knowing that he could never be able to be loved again with his beloved person, Isabella Lou. Lucas determined to lie in order to make Isabella quickly move on and forget about him with no regrets. Somehow, he chose to be a villain in her eyes. And Isabella literally felt like someone just stabbed her. 
                            The pain in her heart and a broken spirit have made her lose interest in everything surrounding her.

                        A month later after, engagement day, Albedo got sick because of her disease. She looked skinny due to losing large amounts of weight. Her face was so pale. She became weaker and weaker; she couldn’t even move her body well. She looked so disappointed because Lucas seemed to not be concerned about her illness at all due to the fact that his fiancé was not the one whom he really liked. Since the day they got engaged, Lucas has always secretly missed Isabella because she is the one who he wanted to spend the rest of his life with. Lucas had always felt sorry for Isabella; she was the one whom he had made a lot of memories with, but they ended up being strangers. One silent night, Albedo had a feeling that she was about to die. She felt hot and was sweating all over her body. She wanted to scream and ask to help but couldn’t, and fortunately, someone was walking toward her, it was Sophia Lou, who had been taking care of Albedo every day. Suddenly, Sophia grabbed a glass of water for Albedo and called Isabella to take the medicines to Albedo. A moment later, Isabella came up with several bottles of medicines on her left hand. She woke her up and gave Albedo a few pills. After taking the medicines, Albedo immediately threw up. After what happened to Albedo, Sophia Lou blamed Isabella that she wanted to kill Albedo because Isabella loves Lucas and wanted to take over her place. The mother nature of Sophia exploded angrily, and she said, “Why did you want to kill my daughter?” Isabella and Albedo were looking at each other with a shocked face. “What did you just say?”, “Why did you call her daughter?” Isabella said to Sophia. “Albedo is my daughter, my real daughter. You and Albedo were born on the same day I wanted my daughter to live in the wealthy family which is having everything that many people wanted to have that’s the reason that I switched you with her”. Mrs. Rosario was hiding in front of the room, hearing all the conversation; she can’t believe what she just heard. She was crying so hard and ran to her room without saying anything. 
                        Everyone in that room realized that she had already heard the whole story.
