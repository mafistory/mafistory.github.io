                        One afternoon, as the weather was quite good, Isabella went to the garden where she had met Lucas for the first time and made some sweet memories with each other. While she was slowly heading towards the swing, she saw a beautiful butterfly flying alone in the garden. She suddenly stopped and thought, "this butterfly must be so sad being all alone in the garden. Hopefully, I won't be like this butterfly." She looked at the swing from quite a distance, smiling and thinking about the handsome young man; Lucas continued walking toward the swing. Isabella seemed happily enjoying the breathtaking view of the garden while swinging slowly. She suddenly looked at the other empty swing, which was on her left hand. And then Isabella started to miss someone. She missed the one who used to sit next to her. She missed Lucas, with whom she had always spent time chit-chatting. He always told her about his problems as well as his dream. The gorgeous smile of Lucas, the soft sweet voice of him, the masculine body of him, as well as the aromatic smell of him, had always been in Isabella's mind. She couldn't help but thinking about Lucas every single day. "Yes, I do love him. I'm really into him," she quietly confessed her love to herself. "I guess he's also into me," she continued smiling beautifully. A moment later, Lucas had arrived with a beautiful fresh flower on his right hand. He handed it to Isabella without saying anything. And then he started to sit on another swing next to Isabella. After being quiet for a short moment, Isabella began the conversation. “Thanks for the flower,” Isabella said. “Thanks for accepting it,” Lucas replied while looking straight into Isabella’s eyes. They looked very happy for being with each other. “I thought you came here by accident. Didn't you?” Isabella asked. Lucas smiled and replied, “I knew that you always come here whenever you’re free. Well, I came here just to meet you. I always think about you every time. That’s what I want you to know”. Isabella smiled beautifully and said “Actually, since the day we knew each other, I always come here whenever I felt bored. It was not because I didn’t have any other places to go, but …" “But this was the only place that gave us a lot of unforgettable memories with each other,” Lucas interrupted. “How did you know that?” Isabella asked. “I guess we have the same feelings,” Lucas responded. They started to look straight into each other's eyes, 
                        getting closer and closer to each other, closing their eyes, and start kissing.

                            A few years later, Albedo, the mistress of Luminé family, had already turned 20. The day of the engagement between Lucas and Albedo that was planned and set by both family since the day she was born had come. It was a huge party known by everyone across the country. The Luminé house was one of the biggest houses in the country. So the engagement party would be held in their mansion. There was no need to hire any venues. Most of the guests of the party were those businessmen who work with both families. Everyone in the house seemed very busy preparing for food, clothes, and other stuff for the party. 
                            Albedo looked very happy as she had been waiting for this day for so long.
