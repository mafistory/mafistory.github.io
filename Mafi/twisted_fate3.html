                            Mrs. Rosario Luminè walked out of the room with a smile on her face after punishing them. Sophia immediately grabbed Isabella's hair, tightly pulled her hair, dragged her outside the room. “Looked what you had done, 
                            how many times I had told you, or you wanted me to hit you harder than before,” Sophia said.
                        </p>

                            Isabella was in a discomfort situation, but she didn’t say anything to her mother instead of letting her mother dragged her down like trash. When Sophia Lou dragged her outside the house, she started to hit Isabella hardly. Her gazed at Isabella showed clearly that how much she despises Isabella. After Isabella got hit by her mother, Sophia Lou told Isabella to do all the housework, and no one in this house bear to her. Isabella standing still with her face straight and her inscrutable expression kept the servants wondering. She knew nothing change for her if she replied back to them. It was her fate that she was born in this family. She continued to do all the things 
                            ordinary because she had no choice and had to face this situation even if she became an adult.

                            As time went by, Young Albedo would turn into an 18-year-old girl in the next few days. The Luminé Mansion was preparing for a magnificent event; it was the Young mistress Albedo’s birthday party. The party was probably the most spectacular event in France; hence the Luminé name was known by everyone throughout the country. The family was famous for their successful business. Therefore, all the invited guests for the party were mostly successful people from the same field. It included the Luminé’s close friends, which was the Adam Family. In the pitch-black room, laid Isabella, who was lost in her thought thinking about how her life would become. “Will I be able to get married and escape from this hell? 
                            Or Am I chained to this devilish household forever?” Isabella talked to herself with a sorrowful face.
