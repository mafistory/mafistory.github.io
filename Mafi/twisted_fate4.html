                            The night before the party began, every slave in the Luminé household worked really hard for the upcoming party. It was no exception the birthday girl, Isabella. Born on the exact same day, 
                            but not even a single soul remembered her birthday. Even her own flesh and blood mother did not care for her.
                        </p>
                        <p style="color:rgb(240, 198, 231); text-indent: 50px;">
                            Tomorrow finally came. The mansion was decorated with every color of flower from the gate to every corner of the mansion. The master and mistress of Luminé family dressed beautifully alongside them was the star of the show, Albedo. Walking down the stairs to greet the guests, Albedo made everyone awe with her beauty. At the main gate, in a fancy horse carriage, sit the Adam family. Young Master Lucas Adam could be considered the most handsome young man in the city. “Lucas, I warn you, young man. No matter you like it or not, don’t be such a rebel child when we get into the party.” his father told him along with a glaring look. “Yes, dear father.” Lucas obediently replied with a forceful smile. 
                            No one knows that behind that smile, he had sadness buried deep inside his heart.

                        After leaving the carriage, he did not go straight into the main house, where the party was being celebrated. Instead, he went to the garden to find a quiet place to release his sadness. Inside the garden, there was a swing. On the swing, sit a young girl with a scar on her face. “Hello! young miss, may I sit with you?“ Lucas walked there and greeted her. She was startled by the sudden greeting. “Be my guest!” she replied. Lucas then nodded with a smile and went to sit near Isabella. At the same time, their eyes met each other. “Why are you here?” “You are not joining the party at the main house?” asked Isabella. “I do not want to join” “Actually, I do not want to come to the party at all,” Lucas answered with a sigh. “Despite your gorgeous smile, I think you look rather sad,” asked Isabella. Lucas stared blankly at her. “Soon, I will inherit my family business,” said Lucas. “Well, that’s great news,” said Isabella. “For me, it is not good news. I do not want that. I have a dream, but my dear Father and mother do not support it.” Lucas said with his eyes red. “What is your dream then, young master?” “Since I was born, I seemed to take a liking to paint. Painter is what I wanted to become, not a businessman.” Lucas answered. Isabella left the swing and was about to leave the garden, but she turned back to tell Lucas her name. “My name is Isabella, by the way. It was nice meeting you, but I really need to go. There is a lot of works that I have to do.” the young girl was seemed to be in a hurry. She rashly said goodbye to the young master. “Lucas, that’s my name. Nice to meet you.” the Young man screamed while the girl was leaving him behind. After that day, Lucas always went to the Luminé mansion in the name of business discussion. But Lucas was always found time to meet with Isabella. As time flew by, the two became closer and closer. Lucas started to open up about his own life to Isabella in the hope of diminishing his stress. The girl always listened to his problem. In the meantime, she began to talk to him about her miserable life. They comforted each other. But there was nothing that the boy can do to free her from her unfortunate life. He could only listen to her difficulty. 
                        And he could only be a shoulder that Isabella can cry on, but nothing more than that.
