                            Everything that had happened to Isabella for ages had made her become a completely new person, a depressed one, the person who she had never imagined herself to be. She couldn’t handle all the stuff that had happened to her, especially what she just had gone through recently. 
                            She thought that her whole life was just a lie, a big lie, and everyone hated her.
                        </p>
                        <p style="color:rgb(240, 198, 231); text-indent: 50px;">
                            After knowing the truth, Isabella has been wholeheartedly grieving and started sobbing without trying. The sad reality is Madame Rosario, who turned out to be her own mother. The witch who was bullied her nonstop and was also the one whom she had feared of. She dropped herself down the floor and whispering, “It can’t be true. I’m Isabella Lou, not Albedo Luminé. I will never be her daughter”. She was seeking help from the reflection of the sun throughout her window inside her room, wondering what she could do for the next step of her life. She was not happy about the news that had stayed hidden for a long time. Her heart broke into pieces, tearing her soul apart. Also, the darkness inside her room locked her up well that no one could see the sight of a pale young woman crying beside the corner of the bed. She could not feel anything at all. The emptiness inside her had eaten her existence until she could not feel like herself anymore. She started to overthink the way to get out of the reality. She prayed that everything was just a nightmare, and she was trying to wake herself up, but it did not work as she prayed for. Suddenly, she encouraged herself to end everything by taking her own life. She just wanted to feel free and released the pain. 
                            She did not need help any longer, so she determined to make it happen.
                        </p>

                            As soon as she finished her thinking, Isabella got up and grabbed a mirror in the room. The girl smashed it. As a result, it made a lot of noise and scattered shards of glasses all over the room. After that, she picked up one of the pieces from the broken glass, and slowly she began to cut her hand. As that sharp glass cut through her soft skin, blood began to appear. As time passed, Isabella had grown weaker from the loss of blood, and she thought to herself, what if she never got swap, what if this never happened, will she be able to live happily, will her own mother accepted her and gave her love. Besides, she wanted to question the god, “if she was born again as a pretty woman, will Lucas love her back?” As this was happening, people heard the noises from the room and wondered what was going on over there. It made them decided to check. By the time they all got there, 
                            it was too late. In front of them was Isabella's lifeless body on the floor in a pool of blood.
