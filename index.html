                        <p style="color:rgb(240, 198, 231)">Sunday at 11:59 pm, in a small town in France, a stormy rain occurred strongly, 
                        as if it was crying for help. The sky was so dark with the lightning strike so loudly, 
                        which seemed to never end. At the moment, Mrs. Rosario lumin√® was 
                        giving birth to a daughter while the slave of their family name, Sophia,

                    and this is the most powerful form of love.
